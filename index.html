							<h3 class="major">About the Workshop</h3>
							This workshop is designed to stimulate a discussion on the state of the art and roadmap for the research and application of advanced techniques on the Motion Planning, Control, and Learning for Autonomous Driving Systems. As we move to increasingly complex transportation systems and more complex urban environments, new approaches are needed to accommodate the challenges associated with agent interactions, planning and control under uncertainty, and long-tail scenarios. The intersection of motion planning, control, and learning provides opportunities to explore the solutions for these challenges and apply those solutions to real-world applications (including driver-assistance systems, connected and automated vehicles, and fully autonomous driving systems).</strong></p>
						    We will discuss the strengths and limitations of the different approaches and assist with system level design choices. We will also discuss how to leverage real world driving data to address the challenges of the motion planning and control of autonomous driving systems through different learning methods.
